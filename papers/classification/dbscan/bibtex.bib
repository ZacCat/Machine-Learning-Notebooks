  abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.}

  abstract = {Density-based clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial database. However, in many cases, very different local-density clusters exist in different regions of data space, therefore, DBSCAN method [M. Ester, H.-P. Kriegel, J. Sander, X. Xu, A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise, in: E. Simoudis, J. Han, U.M. Fayyad (Eds.), Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Portland, OR, AAAI, Menlo Park, CA, 1996, pp. 226â231] using a global density parameter is not suitable. Although OPTICS [M. Ankerst, M.M. Breunig, H.-P. Kriegel, J. Sander, OPTICS: ordering points to identify the clustering structure, in: A. Delis, C. Faloutsos, S. Ghandeharizadeh (Eds.), Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Philadelphia, PA, ACM, New York, 1999, pp. 49â60] provides an augmented ordering of the database to represent its density-based clustering structure, it only generates the clusters with local-density exceeds certain thresholds but not the cluster of similar local-density; in addition, it does not produce clusters of a data set explicitly. Furthermore, the parameters required by almost all the major clustering algorithms are hard to determine although they significantly impact on the clustering result. In this paper, a new clustering algorithm LDBSCAN relying on a local-density-based notion of clusters is proposed. In this technique, the selection of appropriate parameters is not difficult; it also takes the advantage of the LOF [M.M. Breunig, H.-P. Kriegel, R.T. Ng, J. Sander, LOF: identifying density-based local outliers, in: W. Chen, J.F. Naughton, P.A. Bernstein (Eds.), Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Dalles, TX, ACM, New York, 2000, pp. 93â104] to detect the noises comparing with other density-based clustering algorithms. The proposed algorithm has potential applications in business intelligence.}

  abstract={The clustering algorithm DBSCAN relies on a density-based notion of clusters and is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape as well as to distinguish noise. In this paper, we generalize this algorithm in two important directions. The generalized algorithm---called GDBSCAN---can cluster point objects as well as spatially extended objects according to both, their spatial and their nonspatial attributes. In addition, four applications using 2D points (astronomy), 3D points (biology), 5D points (earth science) and 2D polygons (geography) are presented, demonstrating the applicability of GDBSCAN to real-world problems.},

  abstract = {Over the last several years, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) has been widely used in many areas of science due to its simplicity and the ability to detect clusters of different sizes and shapes. However, the algorithm becomes unstable when detecting border objects of adjacent clusters as was mentioned in the article that introduced the algorithm. The final clustering result obtained from DBSCAN depends on the order in which objects are processed in the course of the algorithm run. In this article, a modified version of the DBSCAN algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. It was shown that by using the revised algorithm the clustering results are considerably improved, in particular for data sets containing dense structures with connected clusters.}
