  abstract = {Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data. Such {\textquotedblleft}exemplars{\textquotedblright} can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called {\textquotedblleft}affinity propagation,{\textquotedblright} which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

abstract={The affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm has received much attention in the past few years. AP is appealing because it is efficient, insensitive to initialization, and it produces clusters at a lower error rate than other exemplar-based methods. However, its single-exemplar model becomes inadequate when applied to model multisubclasses in some situations such as scene analysis and character recognition. To remedy this deficiency, we have extended the single-exemplar model to a multi-exemplar one to create a new multi-exemplar affinity propagation (MEAP) algorithm. This new model automatically determines the number of exemplars in each cluster associated with a super exemplar to approximate the subclasses in the category. Solving the model is NP--hard and we tackle it with the max-sum belief propagation to produce neighborhood maximum clusters, with no need to specify beforehand the number of clusters, multi-exemplars, and superexemplars. Also, utilizing the sparsity in the data, we are able to reduce substantially the computational time and storage. Experimental studies have shown MEAP's significant improvements over other algorithms on unsupervised image categorization and the clustering of handwritten digits.},

  abstract={Unsupervised categorization of images or image parts is often needed for image and video summarization or as a preprocessing step in supervised methods for classification, tracking and segmentation. While many metric-based techniques have been applied to this problem in the vision community, often, the most natural measures of similarity (e.g., number of matching SIFT features) between pairs of images or image parts is non-metric. Unsupervised categorization by identifying a subset of representative exemplars can be efficiently performed with the recently-proposed 'affinity propagation' algorithm. In contrast to k-centers clustering, which iteratively refines an initial randomly-chosen set of exemplars, affinity propagation simultaneously considers all data points as potential exemplars and iteratively exchanges messages between data points until a good solution emerges. When applied to the Olivetti face data set using a translation-invariant non-metric similarity, affinity propagation achieves a much lower reconstruction error and nearly halves the classification error rate, compared to state-of-the-art techniques. For the more challenging problem of unsupervised categorization of images from the CaltechlOl data set, we derived non-metric similarities between pairs of images by matching SIFT features. Affinity propagation successfully identifies meaningful categories, which provide a natural summarization of the training images and can be used to classify new input images.},

  abstract={Affinity propagation clustering (AP) has two limitations: it is hard to know what value of parameter ‘preference’ can yield an optimal clustering solution, and oscillations cannot be eliminated automatically if occur. The adaptive AP method is proposed to overcome these limitations, including adaptive scanning of preferences to search space of the number of clusters for finding the optimal clustering solution, adaptive adjustment of damping factors to eliminate oscillations, and adaptive escaping from oscillations when the damping adjustment technique fails. Experimental results on simulated and real data sets show that the adaptive AP is effective and can outperform AP in quality of clustering results.}
